  </card>

</cardlist>

Only the elements necessary for the specific card will be used. The
elements are not necessarily ordered as above.

<type> and <rule> elements will be repeated for each type or rule. The
reminder attribute will only be present if the rule contains reminder
text. The reminder text will in that case be removed from the rule
text itself. Types and rules are always in the same order as on the
card.

The type attribute on the <type> element is one of "super", "card" or
"sub".

    Example:
    <typelist>
        <type type="super">Legendary</type>
        <type type="card">Creature</type>
        <type type="sub">Bunny</type>
        <type type="sub">Ogre</type>
    </typelist>

The no attribute on the <rule> element indicates which rule on the
original card the rule represents. This starts at 1 and counts up. If
a rule on a card consists of multiple keyword abilities that rule will
be split into several rules. The no attribute is used to indicate that
they originally were on the same line.

    Example:
    "Haste, trample, protection from white and red"

    would turn into

    <rulelist>
        <rule no="1">Haste</rule>
        <rule no="1">Trample</rule>
        <rule no="1">Protection from white</rule>
        <rule no="1">Protection from red</rule>
    </rulelist>

<hand> and <life> is used for Vanguard cards.

The <multi> element is used if the card contains multiple facets. This
affects flip, double and transform cards. The type attribute will be
either "flip", "double" or "transform".

</metalist>

The <set> element contains the set-code for the set. The set-code to
name mapping is available in setinfo.xml. The <instance> element can
be repeated any number of times.

Rarity is given as the first letter of the corresponding
rarity. (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic Rare, Special, Promo, Land)

Number is the collectors number for the card.

<multi> may be present if the card has multiple facets. It contains
the data relevant to that facet but does not duplicate data that can
be found elsewhere.
